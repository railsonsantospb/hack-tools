Chomper
=======

Chomper is a Python command-line program which can create blacklists of blocked websites or whitelists of allowed websites for specified periods of time. The program is intended to help people with issues being productive on a computer due to Internet distractions.

Currently, Chomper is only available for GNU Linux, but an OSX port is being developed.
